# Subscription

Subscriptions are not currently supported by Sudograph.

Because the Internet Computer itself does not have any push mechanisms exposed, it will be difficult to provide subscription capabilities in the normal ways e.g. web sockets.

For now you will have to implement your own polling solutions to know when data has been updated.
