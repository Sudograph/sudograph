# Query

Sudograph will generate the equivalent of the `Query` object type based on your GraphQL schema. If you have specified your own `Query` object type, the two object types will be combined into the final `Query` object type.

The only fields in the `Query` object type generated by Sudograph are the [read](./generated-schema-query-read.md) fields.
