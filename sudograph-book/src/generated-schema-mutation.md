# Mutation

Sudograph will generate the equivalent of the `Mutation` object type based on your GraphQL schema. If you have specified your own `Mutation` object type, the two object types will be combined into the final `Mutation` object type.

The fields in the `Mutation` object type generated by Sudograph are:

* [create](./generated-schema-mutation-create.md)
* [update](./generated-schema-mutation-update.md)
* [delete](./generated-schema-mutation-delete.md)
* [init](./generated-schema-mutation-init.md)
